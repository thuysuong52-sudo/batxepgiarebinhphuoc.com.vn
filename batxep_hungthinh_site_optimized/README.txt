Bạt Xếp Hưng Thịnh — Static website (ready)
-------------------------------------------
What is included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- scripts.js
- /images (placeholders)

Next steps to make the site 'perfect' with real images and live forms:
1. Replace images in /images with your real photos:
   - hero-bat.webp (banner)
   - bat-pho-thong.webp
   - bat-trung-cap.webp
   - bat-cao-cap.webp
   - project-1.jpg, project-2.jpg, project-3.jpg (gallery)
2. Convert your photos to WebP for best performance. Filenames above should be kept.
3. To receive form submissions:
   - Option A (quick): Use formspree.io / getform.io / Google Forms and change form action.
   - Option B: Connect to your server API that accepts POST JSON or form-data.
4. Deploy:
   - Upload all files to any static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, Github Pages, or a standard web hosting).
   - Point domain batxepbinhphuoc.vn to the hosting (update DNS A/CNAME records).
5. Optional: Add analytics (Google Analytics), Facebook Pixel, and rich snippets.

If you want, I can:
- Convert your real photos to optimized WebP and replace them inside the zip.
- Deploy the site to Vercel/Netlify for you (I will give instructions to connect your GitHub or provide deployment files).
- Integrate a production contact form (Formspree / Getform) so leads arrive in your email.
